Recorded Performance by Kathryn Nagy

The Recorded Performance component allows for a specified recording (in the form of a .wav file) to be played, with the beat and measure at which it starts in order to allow for proper synchronization with the rest of the song.

Grading Criteria - All specified points. There are 2 effects, in this case fuzz and a dynamic reson filter, and at least 30 points in the score where these effects are controlled by modification. The amount of the fuzz, being the level to which the amplitude of the recording is clipped, is specified in comparison to the overall amplitude of the recording, with 0 meaning no fuzz is applied, and 1 meaning that the maximum fuzz is applied, being equivalent to silencing the recording. The reson filter can be enabled or disabled, along with having the emphasized frequency and band specified. At any point, the values corresponding to these effects can be modified at a point in the recording, specified by the beat and measure at which a particular change will occur. The score for the recording specifies at least 30 points at which a parameter for one of these effects is modified.
